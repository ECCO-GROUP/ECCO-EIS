Downloading EMU Input: A Brief Description
===========================================

EMU's Input Files can be downloaded separately from EMU's setup 
(emu_setup.sh) with shell script
   	       	    
    PUBLICDIR/emu_download_input.sh 
    
The same EMU Input Files directory (emu_input_dir) specified during
EMU setup must be entered when prompted by this script for consitency.
This shell script (emu_download_input.sh) also provides an option to
download the input in batch mode. To do so, PBS commands in batch
script

    PUBLICDIR/pbs_emu_download_input.sh 

which emu_download_input.sh submits, should be modified as necessary
for the host system before running emu_download_input.sh. Commands in

    PUBLICDIR/emu_download_input_4batch.sh 

which this PBS script invokes, may also need to be modified, as
compute nodes on some systems do not have internet access for command
wget to work. (For example, at NAS, wget on a compute node is
conducted by login nodes using syntax "ssh pfe wget" instead of
"wget".)

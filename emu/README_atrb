EMU Attribution Tool: A Brief Description
============================================

What the Tool does:
   This Tool extracts time-series of contributions to a user-defined
   variable of the ECCO estimate from seperate types of controls. The
   Tool is useful in identifying the type of control responsible for
   the variable's variation and to ascertain the accuracty of the
   model's adjoint when using the Convolution Tool. See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU).

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Attribution Tool
   (tool #8).

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.
   
   Output Example:
   > ls -log --time-style=+"" emu_atrb/output
     total 72
     -rw-r--r-- 1   8764 atrb.out_312
     -rw-r--r-- 1   1248 atrb.step_312

   File Description:
   ------------------   

   atrb.out_312
      Monthly anomaly time-series of the objective function for the
      Reference Run (ref) and contributions to it from anomalies in
      different controls; i.e., surface forcing that consists of wind
      (tau), heat flux (htflx), freshwater flux (fwflx), salt flux
      (sflux) and pressure load (pload), and the initial state of the
      ocean (ic). The last number after “_” in the file name indicates
      the number of records in the anomaly time-series. The value 312
      is the number of monthly mean values available from 1992 to 2017
      for V4r4. The time-mean reference for the anomaly is given as
      the last set of variables in the file (mean).

      The file contains the following variables in the order given.
      All variables are 312-element arrays except the last one (mean)
      which is a 7-element array with the time-mean references for the
      seven anomaly variables ref, tau, htflx, fwflx, sflux, pload and
      ic.
      ref: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series of the Reference Run (float)
      tau: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series due to wind anomaly (float)
      htflx: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series due to heat flux anomaly (float)
      fwflx: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series due to freshwater flux anomaly (float)
      sflux: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series due to salt flux anomaly (float)
      pload: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series due to pressure load anomaly (float)
      ic: Array of anomaly OBJF time-series due to initial state anomaly (float)
      mean: Array with time-mean OBJF reference for the variables above (float)

   atrb.step_312 	
      Time (hour from 12Z January 1, 1992) of the monthly mean values
      in atrb.out_312. Time here is the end instant of the averaging
      period of the sampled quantity (e.g., end of month). The file
      contains a single array (float) of 312-elements.

   atrb.txt 	
      A text file equivalent of binary files atrb.step_312 and
      atrb.out_312. The file has time-series of the user specified
      objective function (not its anomaly) listed in table format (see
      first line of file); time (hour from 12Z January 1, 1992),
      Reference Run (ref) and contributions to it from anomalies in
      different controls; i.e., surface forcing that consists of wind
      (tau), heat flux (htflx), freshwater flux (fwflx), salt flux
      (sflux) and pressure load (pload), and the initial state of the
      ocean (ic). The time here is the end instant of the averaging
      period of the sampled quantity (e.g., end of month).

   data.ecco 	
      An ECCO MITgcm namelist file (text file) defining the objective
      function, modified by set_samp.x, and used by do_samp.x to
      extract objective function from different runs.

   set_samp.info 	
      A text file, created by set_samp.x, summarizing the
      user-specified objective function.

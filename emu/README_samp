=========================================
Quick guide to run the Sampling Tool
=========================================

Skip to step c) if you have already run setup_ad.csh. "pfe25>" denotes
the Unix prompt on Pleiades.

a) Create and cd to some work directory (USRDIR, change as preferred).

    pfe25>mkdir USRDIR

    pfe25>cd USRDIR

b) Set up Sampling Tool.

    pfe25>source PUBLICDIR/setup_samp.csh

c) Run Sampling Tool (follow the prompt). 

    pfe25>samp.x 

d) Results will be generated in subdirectory emu_samp_*****


============
Description 
============

The Sampling Tool extracts time-series of a user-defined variable of
the model, hereafter the Objective Function (J). The Objective
Function can simply be one of the standard state variables (v; sea
level, ocean bottom pressure, temperature, salinity, velocity) at a
particular model grid point or a user-defined linear function
(combination, transformation) of these variables (e.g., spatial
integral, steric sea level). In its general form, the Objective
Function is written as,

    J(t) = sum_i alpha_i sum_x T_i(x) * v_i(x,t)

where "t" is time, "alpha" is a scalar multiplication factor
(scaling), "T" is a linear operator (weight) in space (x), and
subscript i distinguishes different variables. (The Tool allows the
Objective Function to be a combination of any number of variables.)

The Sampling Tool is useful for assessing the fidelity of V4r4; e.g.,
comparison to observations.

To run the tool, do the following.  

Skip to step 3 if you have already run setup_samp.csh. "pfe25>" denotes the
Unix prompt on Pleiades. 

1) Create and cd to some work directory. Results and pertinent files
   will be created under this directory.

    pfe25>mkdir USRDIR

    pfe25>cd USRDIR

2) Set up Samplint Tool.

    pfe25>source PUBLICDIR/setup_samp.csh

3) Extract time-series of the quantity of interest (Objective
   Function) by running program samp.x and responding to its prompts.

   The example below extracts monthly-mean time-series of dynamic sea
   level at a model grid point closest to 148W 73.1N, which is model
   grid point (85, 604).

   ------------------
      Choose OBFJ variable # 1 ... (1-5)?  
      (Enter 0 to end variable selection)
    1 

     OBJF variable  1 is SSH
     Choose either VARIABLE at a point (1) or VARIABLE weighted in space (2) ... (1/2)?
    1      
    ... OBJF will be a scaled VARIABLE at a point

      Enter 1 to select native grid location (i,j),
        or 9 to select by longitude/latitude ... (1 or 9)?

      Choose OBFJ variable # 2 ... (1-5)?  
      (Enter 0 to end variable selection)
   0

   Sampling Tool output will be in : emu_samp_m_1_85_604_1.    

   Sampling MONTHLY means ...  

    nobjf =            1. 

      Mask file : objf_1_mask_C.  
      Masks maximum absolute value =   1.0000E+00
   	    at (i,j) =   85   604  

   ... Done.

4) The Sampling Tool creates output in a directory bearing
   specification of the extracted variable (Objective Function) in its
   name, which is emu_samp_m_1_85_604_1 for the case above. Here
   "emu_samp" indicates output from the Sampling Tool, "m" for monthly
   mean variable, "1" for SSH, "85_604" for location (i,j)=(85, 604),
   and the last "1" for number of variables defining the Objective
   Function (nobjf=1).

   The files in this directory for the example above are.  

   pfe24>ls -l emu_samp_m_85_604_1
   total 5
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ifukumor g26113  335 Nov  3 10:21 data.ecco
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ifukumor g26113  465 Nov  3 10:21 samp.info
   -rw-r--r-- 1 ifukumor g26113 1252 Nov  3 10:21 samp.out_312

   The sampled variable is in file samp.out_312 as an anomaly
   time-series from its time-mean in binary format; The last number
   after "_" indicates the number of records in the time-series, which
   in this case is 312 monthly mean values from 1992 to 2017 of V4r4's
   analysis period. An example FORTRAN code to read this output file
   is given below.

   File samp.info is a text file summarizing the user-defined
   Objective Function and file data.ecco is an ECCO MITgcm input file
   defining the objective function.

FORTRAN
      integer nrec
      parameter (nrec=312)
      real*4 anom(nrec), ref
      character*256 f_in

      f_in = 'samp.out _312'
      open(60, file=trim(f_in), action=?read?, access=?stream?)
      read(60) anom       !  Anomaly time-series of the Objective Function.
      read(60) ref        !  Time-mean reference of the anomaly.

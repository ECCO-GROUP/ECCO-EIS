EMU Sampling Tool: A Brief Description
========================================

What the Tool does:
   The Tool extracts time-series of a user-defined variable of the
   ECCO estimate, V4r4, that can either be the state or control
   (forcing). The Tool is useful for assessing the fidelity of this
   model and is part of ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional tools. 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Sampling Tool
   (tool #1).

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.
   
   Output Example:
   > ls -log --time-style=+"" emu_samp/output
   total 28
   -rw-r--r-- 1   332 data.ecco
   -rw-r--r-- 1   654 samp.info
   -rw-r--r-- 1  1252 samp.out_312
   -rw-r--r-- 1  1248 samp.step_312
   -rw-r--r-- 1 10642 samp.txt 

   ------------------
   File Description:
   ------------------   

   File samp.txt is a text file with the time-series of the user
   specified variable, with time (1-hour time-step from 12Z January 1,
   1992) and corresponding sampled quantity listed in a table
   format. The time here is the end instant of the averaging period of
   the sampled quantity (e.g., end of month).

   Files samp.out_312 and samp.step_312 are equivalent to samp.txt but
   in binary format. File samp.out_312 has anomaly time-series of the
   sampled quantity from its time-mean (float); The last number after
   “_” in the file name indicates the number of records in the anomaly
   time-series, which in this case is 312 monthly mean values from
   1992 to 2017 of V4r4’s analysis period. The time-mean reference
   value (float) is given as the last variable in the file (313th in
   the example above.) File samp.step_312 has the time record of the
   time-series (integer). An example FORTRAN code to read these binary
   output files is given below.

   File samp.info is a text file summarizing the user-defined
   Objective Function and file data.ecco is an ECCO MITgcm input file
   defining the objective function.

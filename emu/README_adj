ECCO Adjoint Tool: A Brief Description
=======================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool computes the model's sensitivity to different controls,
   i.e., adjoint gradient. The Tool is useful for analyzing the
   model's dependence on different forcing, including identification
   of forcing responsible for the model's variation (cf Convolution
   Tool). See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute shell script emu_adj.csh and follow its prompt; e.g., 
   source PUBLICDIR/emu_adj.csh

For detailed description: 
   See Sections 1, 2.3, and 3.3 of the EMU User Guide;

EMU Adjoint Tool: A Brief Description
=======================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool computes the model's sensitivity to different controls,
   i.e., adjoint gradient. The Tool is useful for analyzing the
   model's dependence on different forcing, including identification
   of forcing responsible for the model's variation (cf Convolution
   Tool). See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Adjoint Tool
   (tool #3).  

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.

   The Adjoint Tool creates files in a directory bearing its objective
   function’s specification in its name, e.g.,
   emu_adj_24_24_1_beaufortsea.msk_1. Here “emu_adj” indicates output
   from the Adjoint Tool, “24_24” for the first and last months of the
   Objective Function’s averaging period, “beaufortsea.msk” for the
   file name of the spatial mask used, and “1” for the number of
   variables defining the Objective Function (nobjf=1). User output is
   collected in a subdirectory named output.

   File Description:
   ------------------   

   adj.info: 	
      A text file summarizing the objective function created by adj.x.

   adxx_***CTRL***_0000000129.data 
   adxx_***CTRL***_0000000129.meta 
      Adjoint gradient in MITgcm output format; "data" files are
      binary, "meta" files are text files with "data" file
      information. ***CTRL*** is the name of the modelâs different
      forcing (Table 3).  (0000000129 is the âiterationâ number of the
      particular ECCO estimate.)

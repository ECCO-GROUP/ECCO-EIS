Setting up ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU) 
===========================================

EMU can be installed by downloading and executing its setup shell
script emu_setup.sh. Do the following and follow the script's prompt; 

   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-EIS/main/emu/emu_setup.sh
   chmod +x ./emu_setup.sh
   ./emu_setup.sh

The shell script will install EMU's Programs (~1GB), its User
Interface (~2MB), and download its Input Files (~1TB) to
user-specified directories.

Users should not move or alter these directories or their files unless
noted otherwise (e.g., conforming batch scripts pbs_*.sh for the host
system, installed in the User Interface directory). Once installed,
any user of the host system should be able to utilize the installed
files and programs; Separate installations for different users are not
necessary.

Installation requires obtaining a NASA Earthdata account for
downloading files from https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/. Enter your
Earthdata username and WebDAV password (*NOT* your Earthdata password)
when prompted by the script. The WebDAV password can be found at this
URL after logging in with your Earthdata username and Earthdata
password, or click the 'Back to WebDAV Credentials' button when
browsing files at the URL.

See the README file that will be installed in the User Interface directory 
for details of EMU, including instructions on how to use it.

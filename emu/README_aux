EMU Auxillary Tools: A Brief Description
============================================

What the Tool does:
   This Tool generates examples of what other EMU tools employ as
   user input files. The example input files include; 

   1) Masks defining objective function [misc_mask.sh], 
   2) Replacement files for Modified Simulation Tool; 
      a) File (file named 'data') specifying model integration period
         (i.e., start and duration) [misc_msim_data.sh], 
      b) File (file named 'data.diagnostics') specifying diagnostic
         output (i.e., variable and its temporal and spatial
         sampling) [misc_msim_diagnostics.sh], 
      c) Time-mean forcing files in place of ECCO's time-variable
         estimates [misc_msim_forcing.sh],
      d) Initial condition file with time-mean state in place of
         ECCO's estimate [misc_msim_ic.sh], 
      e) Initial condition file with the end state from another
         simulation and corresponding 'data' file specifying model
         integration period [misc_pickup.sh], 

    Item 1) is provided for reference only; EMU's individual tools
    provide the same utility. 

    Item 2a) should *NOT* be used in conjunction with 2e) as one will
    overwrite what the other creates.

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Auxillary Tool
   (tool #9).

Output:
   Files are generated in user-defined directories prompted by the
   tool.

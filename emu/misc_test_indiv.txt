# Progress can be followed in terminal output and the script's log
# file misc_test_suite.log which includes timing information of each
# Example. 
# 
# Progress for Examples 2) Forward Gradient and 7) Modified Simulation 
# can additionally be monitored, respectively, by
#    ls ./emu_fgrd*/temp/diags/*2d*day*data | wc -l
#    ls ./emu_msim*/temp/diags/*2d*day*data | wc -l
# which should reach 396, the total number of days that the model is
# integrated (nominally one year plus one month). 
#
# Progress for Example 3) Adjoint can be monitored by
#    grep ad_time_tsnumber ./emu_adj*/temp/STDOUT.0000 | tail -n 3
# which counts down from 4320 to 240. Variable ad_time_tsnumber is the
# 1-hour time-step number of the adjoint model printed backward every
# 10-days (240).

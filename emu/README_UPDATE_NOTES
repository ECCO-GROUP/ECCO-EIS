Version 2.0a (04/08/2025)
   - Added sampling of control (forcing) to Sampling Tool (samp). 

   - Can start model integration from the beginning of any year
     (1992-2017) for Forward Gradient (fgrd) and Adjoint (adj) Tools,
     and not just from 1992.

   - Added volume transport as a menu-driven choice for objective
     function for Sampling (samp), Adjoint (adj), and Attribution
     (atrb) Tools.

   - Added Auxillary Tool (aux), a collection of tools that generates
     examples of what other EMU Tools employ as user input. This
     includes replacement files for the Modified Simulation Tool
     (msim);
       a) Specify model integration period (start and duration), 
       b) Specify diagnostic state output (variable and its sampling), 
       c) Replace forcing with its time-mean,
       d) Replace model initial condition with the state's time-mean,
       e) Specify the end state from another simulation as the initial
          condition for another simulation. 
     
   - Revised Modified Simulation Tool (msim) to copy all files from
     the user directory to the Tool's run directory, allowing, for
     example, starting the model integration from the end state of
     another integration.
   
   - Allow Forward Gradient Tool (fgrd) to use runs other than the
     ECCO estimate (emu_ref) as a reference, such as results of the
     Modified Simulation Tool (msim). This option allows the Foward
     Gradient Tool to compare simulations started from the same year
     to minimize numerical errors associated with restarting the model
     from different years.

   - Revised EMU Input File download scripts (emu_input_install.sh,
     emu_input_install_4batch.sh);
       a) Download in parallel as background jobs, 
       b) Only download new files (-N) and resume partial downloads
          (-c). 

   - Runs singularity with the -e option to minimize conflict with the
     host's environment.

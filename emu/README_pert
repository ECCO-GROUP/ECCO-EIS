ECCO Perturbation Tool: A Brief Description
============================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool computes the model's response to a perturbation in its
   control, viz., forward gradient. The Tool is useful for analyzing
   the ocean's response to change in forcing and for assessing the
   accuracy of the model's adjoint gradients (cf Adjoint Tool.) See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute shell script emu_pert.csh and follow its prompt; e.g., 
   source PUBLICDIR/emu_pert.csh

For detailed description: 
   See Sections 1, 2.2, and 3.2 of the EMU User Guide;

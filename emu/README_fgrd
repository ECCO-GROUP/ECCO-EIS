EMU Forward Gradient Tool: A Brief Description
============================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool computes the model's response to a perturbation in its
   control, viz., forward gradient. The Tool is useful for analyzing
   the ocean's response to change in forcing and for assessing the
   accuracy of the model's adjoint gradients (cf Adjoint Tool.) See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Forward Gradient
   Tool (tool #2).

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.

   The Forward Gradient Tool creates files in a directory bearing the
   perturbation’s specification in its name, e.g.,
   emu_fgrd_7_87_605_518_-1.00E-01. Here “emu_fgrd” indicates output
   from the Forward Gradient Tool, “7” for perturbing tauu, “87_605”
   for the perturbation’s location (i,j)=(87, 605), “518” for
   perturbing week 518, and the last “-1.00E-01” for perturbation
   magnitude. User output is collected in a subdirectory named output.

   File Description:
   ------------------   

   fgrd_xx.nml: 	
      Namelist file with specifics of the perturbation saved for
      reference.

   state_2d_set1_day.***TIMESTEP***.data
   state_2d_set1_day.***TIMESTEP***.meta
   
   state_2d_set1_mon.***TIMESTEP***.data
   state_2d_set1_mon.***TIMESTEP***.meta

   state_3d_set1_mon.***TIMESTEP***.data
   state_3d_set1_mon.***TIMESTEP***.meta

      Forward gradient in MITgcm diagnostic output format; "data" are
      binary, "meta" are text files with "data" file information. The
      ***TIMESTEP*** in the filenames are model time-steps (center
      step of average); each file corresponds to a particular
      instant. The fields are on the model's native grid.

      Files "state_2d_set1_day" have gradients of daily mean dynamic
      sea level (ssh) and ocean bottom pressure (obp) on the model’s
      2-dimensional horizontal grid. Files "state_2d_set1_mon" have
      monthly means of these same variables. Units are meters for both
      variables (equivalent sea level for obp) per unit perturbation
      of the chosen control.

      Files "state_3d_set1_mon" have gradients of monthly mean
      temperature (theta; deg C), salinity (salt; PSU), i-direction
      velocity (uvel; m/s), and j-direction velocity (vvel; m/s) on
      the model’s 3-dimensional grid per unit perturbation of the
      chosen control. (NOTE: Although controls tauu and tauv are
      westward and southward on the native grid, uvel and vvel are in
      the model’s i- and j-directions.)

      Units and direction of the different controls are (as noted by
      fgrd.x prompts),
      control (1) = 'empmr'   'kg/m2/s (upward freshwater flux)'		 
      control (2) = 'pload'   'N/m2 (downward surface pressure loading)'	
      control (3) = 'qnet'    'W/m2 (net upward heat flux)'		
      control (4) = 'qsw'     'W/m2 (net upward shortwave radiation)'	
      control (5) = 'saltflux’ 'g/m2/s (net upward salt flux)'		
      control (6) = 'spflx'   'g/m2/s (net downward salt plume flux)'	
      control (7) = 'tauu'    'N/m2 (westward wind stress)'		
      control (8) = 'tauv'    'N/m2 (southward wind stress)'

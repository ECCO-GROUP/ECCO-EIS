Downloading EMU Input: A Brief Description
===========================================

Instead of downloading during EMU setup by emu_setup.sh, EMU's Input
Files can be downloaded separately using shell script
   	       	    
    PUBLICDIR/emu_input_setup.sh 
    
This shell script also provides an option to download the input files
in batch mode. To do so in batch, PBS commands in batch script

    PUBLICDIR/pbs_input_setup.sh 

which emu_input_setup.sh submits to the batch system, should be
modified as necessary for the host computing environment before
running emu_input_setup.sh. Commands in

    PUBLICDIR/emu_input_install_4batch.sh 

which this PBS script invokes should also be examined. Tailored for
systems at NAS, "wget" in this script is conducted by login nodes
using syntax "ssh pfe wget", as NAS compute nodes do not have internet
access. The command "ssh pfe wget" in this file should be changed for
different hosts.

EMU Modified Simulation Tool: A Brief Description
============================================

What the Tool does:
   The Tool runs the flux-forced version of the ECCO V4r4 model with
   an option to replace any of its input files, such as the model's
   forcing and initial condition (controls), what is output
   (data.diagnostics file) etc, with user-provided versions of these
   files. The Tool is useful for analyzing the ocean's response to
   these changes and/or to output what is not available as "standard
   output." See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU).

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Modified
   Simulation Tool (tool #7).  

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.

   The Modified Simulation Tool creates files in a directory bearing
   the directory name of the user replacement files, e.g.,
   emu_msim_REPLACE. Here “emu_msim” indicates output from the
   Modified Simulation Tool, and "REPLACE" for user replacement file
   directory. Files in this Tool generated directory are equivalent to
   those of the Reference Run (emu_ref). In particular, the diagnostic
   output (state) can be found in subdirectory "diags". See Wang et
   al. (2021, 2022) for details.

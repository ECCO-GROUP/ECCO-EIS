EMU Tracer Tool: A Brief Description
======================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool computes the temporal evolution of a user-specified tracer
   and its adjoint. The Tool is useful for analyzing the origin and
   fate of water masses and for identifying pathways of ocean
   circulation.  See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Tracer Tool
   (tool #5).  

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.

   The Tracer Tool creates files in a directory bearing the tracer
   specification in its name, e.g., emu_trc_30_90_15_803_1. Here
   “emu_trc” indicates output from the Tracer Tool, “30_90” for the
   start and ending dates (1992-day) of the integration, “15_803_1”
   describing the initial perturbation perturbation which is grid
   (i,j,k)=(15, 803,1) in the example. User output is collected in a
   subdirectory named output.

   File Description:
   ------------------   

   trc.info 	
      A text file summarizing the tracer computation specified by
      trc.x.

   ptracer_mon_mean.***TIMESTEP***.data
   ptracer_mon_mean.***TIMESTEP***.meta
      “Monthly” average tracer distribution in MITgcm diagnostic
      output format; "data" are binary files and "meta" are text files
      with "data" file information. The ***TIMESTEP*** in the
      filenames are model time-steps (1-hour time-steps) of each
      average from V4r4’s initial instant (12Z 01 January 1992). These
      time-steps correspond to the end of each succeeding averaging
      period, which is nominally 30.5-days.

   ptracer_mon_snap.***TIMESTEP***.data
   ptracer_mon_snap.***TIMESTEP***.meta
      Tracer distribution at particular instances (“snapshots”) in
      MITgcm diagnostic output format; "data" are binary files and
      "meta" are text files with "data" file information. The
      ***TIMESTEP*** in the filenames are model time-steps (1-hour
      time-steps) of each instant from V4r4’s initial instant (12Z 01
      January 1992). These files are the same as corresponding
      ptracer_mon_mean files but the output here is instantaneous
      values instead of time-mean in the latter (30.5-day average).

EMU Budget Tool: A Brief Description
======================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool extracts flux time-series from ECCO V4r4 model output for
   budget analyses of user-chosen quantities (volume, heat, salt,
   momentum). See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Budget Tool
   (tool #6).  

Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.

   The Budget Tool creates files in a directory bearing specification
   of the budget in its name, e.g.,
   emu_budg_m_2_-170.0_-120.0_-5.0_5.0_50.0_0.0. Here “emu_budg”
   indicates output from the Budget Tool, “m” for monthly mean
   variable, “2” for Heat Budget, “-170.0_-120.0_-5.0_5.0_50.0_0.0”
   for the interactively chosen range of longitude, latitude, and
   depth of the volume. User output is collected in a subdirectory
   named output.

   budg.info 	
      A text file, created by budg.x, summarizing the user-specified
      budget computation.

   data.ecco 	
      An ECCO MITgcm namelist file (text file) defining the objective
      function, modified by budg.x, and used by do_budg.x to conduct
      the budget computation.

   emu_budg.mkup_****
      Time-series of spatially varying converging fluxes making up
      individual terms of the budget. These files are useful for
      analyzing the spatial location of the fluxes contributing to the
      budgeted quantity. Time-series of the spatial sum of these files
      are summarized in emu_budg.sum_tend. The string **** indicates
      particular terms in the budget summarized below for heat
      budget. See Piecuch (2022) for description of the terms.  (Some
      of these files will be absent if the budget has no corresponding
      elements, as in geothermal flux in the example above.) Per
      divergence theorem, the fluxes are those along the bounding
      surface of the budget’s domain (2d surface in 3d space), except
      for short-wave radiation that penetrates the volume (included in
      emu_budg.mkup_atm for this heat budget example.)  (Sea ice’s
      salt-plume flux, a component for salt and salinity budgets, is
      also a penetrative flux deposited inside a budget’s volume.)

      adv_x: Advection in the horizontal i-direction.
      adv_y: Advection in the horizontal j-direction.
      adv_z: Advection in the vertical r-direction.
      atm: Fluxes from atmosphere & sea ice.
      geo: Geothermal heating.
      mix_x: Mixing in the horizontal i-direction.
      mix_y: Mixing in the horizontal j-direction.
      mix_z_e: Explicit mixing in the vertical r-direction.
      mix_z_i: Implicit mixing (convection) in the vertical r-direction.

      For volume budget, possible terms are
      adv_x: Advection in the horizontal i-direction.
      adv_y: Advection in the horizontal j-direction.
      adv_z: Advection in the vertical r-direction.
      srf: Surface fluxes.

      For salt budget, possible terms are
      adv_x: Advection in the horizontal i-direction.
      adv_y: Advection in the horizontal j-direction.
      adv_z: Advection in the vertical r-direction.
      frc_sflux: Surface salt flux from sea ice.
      frc_oceSP: Penetrative salt flux from sea ice.
      mix_x: Mixing in the horizontal i-direction.
      mix_y: Mixing in the horizontal j-direction.
      mix_z_e: Explicit mixing in the vertical r-direction.
      mix_z_i: Implicit mixing (convection) in the vertical r-direction.

      The salinity budget does not take a divergence form and does not
      have directional information. For brevity, the spatial
      distribution of the fluxes that make up the budget are not
      individually output by the Tool. (Each term is 3-dimensional
      spanning the domain of interest making the file sizes much
      larger, if saved, than those for fluxes on the domain’s
      boundary.)  Spatially integrated summary of the salinity budget
      is, as are other budgets, given in files emu_budg.sum_tend and
      emu_budg.sum_tint described below.

      The files contain the following items in this order;
      msk: A single character identifying the spatial location of the
           fluxes (character). The character corresponds to string ?
           in file emu_budg.msk3d_? below that defines this location.
      i31: The term number in file emu_budg.sum_tend that fluxes in
           this file are aggregated in (integer)
      b3d: An array of n3d elements with the fluxes where n3d is given
           in file emu_budg.msk3d_? (float)

      Array b3d is repeated for each month that is available (which
      totals nmonths in file emu_budg.sum_tend).

   emu_budg.msk3d_? 	
      Spatial location of the convergence in files
      emu_budg.mkup_****. The string ?  is a letter denoting the type
      of location described below. The location string (?) is also the
      first record of each convergence file (emu_budg.mkup_****)
      indicating the corresponding location for the converging fluxes
      in that file.

      a: Location of fluxes at the ocean surface including shortwave radiation.
      v: Location spanning the entire volume of the domain.
      x: Location of fluxes in the horizontal i-direction.
      y: Location of fluxes in the horizontal j-direction.
      z: Location of fluxes in the vertical r-direction.

      s: Location of fluxes at the ocean surface.
      g: Location of geothermal fluxes (ocean bottom).

      The files contain the following items in this order;
         n3d: number of locations in file (integer)
	 f3d: array with n3d elements used as weights in extracting fluxes (float)
	 i3d: array with n3d elements indicating i-index of the flux (integer)
	 j3d: array with n3d elements indicating j-index of the flux (integer)
	 k3d: array with n3d elements indicating k-index of the flux (integer)

   emu_budg.sum_tend 	
      Spatially integrated summary scalar time-series of each term in
      the budget (tendency budget). (File is created as unit 31 in
      do_budg.f) The file contains the following items in this order;

      ibud: type of budget (integer, 2 for heat budget)
      nmonths: number of months (integer)
      tname: name of variable (fixed-length string with 12 characters)
      tvar: variable (float array with nmonths elements)

      The pair of records tname and tvar are repeated for all items
      that make up the budget, which differ with budget type and
      budget domain. The first pair is always the length of time
      (hours) for each month (tname=dt) and the second pair is always
      the left-hand-side of the budget (tname=lhs). The left-hand-side
      is given here for reference purpose only in checking consistency
      with terms on the right-hand-side of the budget in this file.
      The left-hand-side in this file is based on instantaneous states
      at the end of the month, except for the first and last months
      whose tendency is artificially set to zero due to missing
      output.

      For heat budget, there are an additional six possible pairs for
      tname and tvar depending on domain. The variable name tname for
      these six are;
advh: horizontal advection (sum of emu_budg.mkup_adv_x and emu_budg.mkup_adv_y)
mixh: horizontal mixing (sum of emu_budg.mkup_mix_x and emu_budg.mkup_mix_y.)
advv: vertical advection 
mixv: vertical mixing (sum of emu_budg.mkup_mix_z_e and emu_budg.mkup_mix_z_i.)
tfrc: surface forcing (atmosphere & sea ice)
geo: geothermal forcing

      For volume budget, there are an additional three possible pairs
      for tname and tvar depending on domain. The variable name tname
      for these three are;
advh: horizontal advection (sum of emu_budg.mkup_adv_x and emu_budg.mkup_adv_y)
advv: vertical advection 
vfrc: surface forcing 

      For salt budget, there are an additional five possible pairs for
      tname and tvar depending on domain. The variable name tname for
      these five are;
advh: horizontal advection (sum of emu_budg.mkup_adv_x and emu_budg.mkup_adv_y)
mixh: horizontal mixing (sum of emu_budg.mkup_mix_x and emu_budg.mkup_mix_y.)
advv: vertical advection 
mixv: vertical mixing (sum of emu_budg.mkup_mix_z_e and emu_budg.mkup_mix_z_i.)
sfrc: surface forcing (sea ice)

      For salinity budget, there are an additional five possible pairs
      for tname and tvar depending on domain. The variable name tname
      for these five are;
advh_slt: horizontal advection of salt
advh_vol: horizontal advection of volume
mixh: horizontal mixing 
advv_slt: vertical advection of salt
advv_vol: vertical advection of volume
mixv: vertical mixing 
sfrc_slt: surface forcing of salt (sea ice)
sfrc_vol: surface forcing of volume

   emu_budg.sum_tint	
      Time-integral of the tendency budget (emu_budg.sum_tend). This
      file is useful for assessing processes controlling the quantity
      of interest itself (volume, heat, salt, salinity) instead of its
      tendency. The file content is the same as emu_budg.sum_tend but
      with all variables (except tname=dt) time-integrated relative to
      the second month.

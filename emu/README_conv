This README file describes the ECCO Convolution Tool, set up on
Pleiades. (19 December 2022. Ichiro Fukumori; fukumori@jpl.nasa.gov)

=========================================
Quick guide to run the Convolution Tool
=========================================

Skip to step c) if you have already run setup_conv.csh. "pfe25>"
denotes the Unix prompt on Pleiades.

a) Create and cd to some work directory (USRDIR, change as preferred).

    pfe25>mkdir USRDIR

    pfe25>cd USRDIR

b) Set up Convolution Tool.

    pfe25>source PUBLICDIR/setup_conv.csh

c) Specify what is to be convolved (follow the prompt). 

    pfe25>conv.x 

d) Run Convolution Tool's computation.

    pfe25>source do_conv.csh

e) Results will be generated in subdirectory emu_conv_*****


============
Description 
============

The Convolution Tool computes the product of a particular set of
adjoint gradients (e.g., ECCO Adjoint Tool) and variations of
corresponding controls, which is useful for approximating changes in
the gradients' Objective Function.  The gradients' target instant
being parametrically defined, the product is a convolution over
different temporal lags between the gradients and the controls.

The Tool assumes the controls that define both the denominator of the
gradients and the forcing used in the convolution having weekly
temporal resolution. 

To run the Tool, do the following.  

Skip to step 3 if you have already run setup_conv.csh. "pfe25>"
denotes the Unix prompt on Pleiades.

1) Create and cd to some work directory. Results and pertinent files
   will be created under this directory.

    pfe25>mkdir USRDIR

    pfe25>cd USRDIR

2) Set up Convolution Tool.

    pfe25>source PUBLICDIR/setup_conv.csh

   This will create files in USRDIR necessary to run the tool. 

3) Specify the convolution (forcing, gradients, maximum lag). 

   Respond to the prompt (?) of conv.x interactively. For instance,
   the example below selects the following
        forcing: V4r4's forcing (7-day averages) 
        gradients: Adjoint Tool output for mean December 1993 sea
		   level averaged over the Beaufort Sea
	maximum lag: 105 weeks

    pfe25>conv.x
    Convolution Tool ...

    Specify forcing, adjoint gradient, and maximum lag below ...

    V4r4 weekly forcing is in directory
      SETUPDIR/forcing/other/flux-forced/forcing_weekly. 

    Use V4r4's weekly forcing  ... (Y/N)?
	Y

    Reading forcing from directory Confirmation of forcing used.
     SETUPDIR/forcing/other/flux-forced/forcing_weekly

    Specify adjoint gradients ...
      Gradients must have equivalent file and directory names as
      Adjoint Tool output. Gradient files must be named
      adxx_***CTRL***..0000000129.data etc 
      and be present in a directory named 'adj_result'
      under a parent directory prefixed 'emu_adj_' 

    Enter directory name of Adjoint Tool output or its equivalent ... ?
    emu_adj_24_24_1_f21_a_1_a.beaufort_1/adj_result       

      Reading adxx from
      emu_adj_24_24_1_f21_a_1_a.beaufort_1/adj_result

      number of adxx records = 107  

      Zero lag at (weeks) = 106

    Enter maximum lag (weeks) to use in convolution ... (0-105)?
    105     
      nlag =  105

    Convolution Tool output will be in :
    emu_conv_24_24_1_f21_a_1_a.beaufort_1_105

    ... Done conv setup (conv.out).   


4) Compute the convolution by running shell script do_conv.csh. (This
   computation is done for each control in parallel using GNU
   Parallel.) 

    pfe25>source do_conv.csh

    Conducting adxx-ctrl convolution ...

    ctrl read from = SETUPDIR/forcing/other/flux-forced/forcing_weekly
    adxx read from = emu_adj_24_24_1_f21_a_1_a.beaufort_1/adj_result
    number of adxx records = 107
    Zero lag at (weeks) = 106
    maximum lag (weeks) = 105
    Output will be in : emu_conv_24_24_1_f21_a_1_a.beaufort_1_105

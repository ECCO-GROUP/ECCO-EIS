ECCO Convolution Tool: A Brief Description
===========================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool computes the convolution of a particular set of adjoint 
   gradients (cf Adjoint Tool) with corresponding controls
   (forcing). The Tool is useful for analyzing causal relationships
   between the model and its controls. See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute shell script emu_conv.csh and follow its prompt; e.g.,
   source PUBLICDIR/emu_conv.csh

For detailed description: 
   See Sections 1, 2.4, and 3.4 of the EMU User Guide;

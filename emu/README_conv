EMU Convolution Tool: A Brief Description
===========================================

What the Tool does: 
   The Tool evaluates the convolution of a particular set of adjoint 
   gradients (cf Adjoint Tool) with corresponding controls
   (forcing). The Tool is useful for analyzing causal relationships
   between the model and its controls. See
   PUBLICDIR/README
   for additional ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU). 

How to run the Tool:
   Execute command emu (linked to emu.sh) and select Convolution 
   Tool (tool #4).
   
Output:
   Unless noted otherwise, all files are binary files. Numbers in
   EMU’s binary input and output files are 32-bit big endian for both
   float and integer.

   The Convolution Tool creates files in a directory bearing the
   convolution’s specification in its name, e.g.,
   emu_conv_24_24_1_beaufortsea.msk_1_105. Here “emu_conv” indicates
   output from the Convolution Tool and “24_24_1_beaufortsea.msk_1”
   corresponds to the adjoint gradient used, and the last “105” is the
   maximum lag used. User output is collected in a subdirectory named
   output.

   ------------------   

   recon2d_***CTRL***.data 	
      Two-dimensional time-series of the convolution for individual
      controls, ***CTRL*** (Table 3),
      		Equation (9) 
      This sum is a function of space (r) and time (t) for a
      particular control (i). The quantity represents a partial sum of
      the terms on the RHS of Eq (7), and is useful in analyzing
      contributions from different locations of each separate
      control (e.g., Figure 9 of Fukumori et al., 2021).

   recon1d_***CTRL***.data 	
      Time-series of global sum of the convolution at different
      maximum lags (k) for individual controls, ***CTRL*** (Table 3),
      	      Equation (10)
      This sum is a function time (t) and maximum lag (k) for a
      particular control (i). The quantity represents a partial sum of
      the terms on the RHS of Eq (7), and is useful in analyzing
      contributions up to different lags of each separate control
      (e.g., Figure 10 of Fukumori et al., 2021).

   istep_***CTRL***.data 	
      Time (t) of the convolution time-series for individual controls,
      ***CTRL*** (Table 3), defined as the end instant of each period
      (e.g., end of the 7-day mean), in terms of the model’s time-step
      (1-hour time-step from 12Z January 1, 1992.) (Different forcing
      files can span different periods.)

   conv.info  
      Specification of convolution set by conv.x, identifying forcing,
      adjoint gradients, maximum lag used, and name of output
      directory.

   conv.out  
      Same as conv.info but without the comments (read by do_conv.x.)

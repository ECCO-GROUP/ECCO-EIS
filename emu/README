ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU): A Brief Description
===================================================

What EMU does: 
   EMU consists of computational tools to analyze the ECCO model in
   addition to its state. The tools include the following; 

   1) Sampling Tool (samp); Extracts time-series from the model. 
   2) Perturbation Tool (pert); Computes forward gradient. 
   3) Adjoint Tool (adj); Computes adjoint gradient. 
   4) Convolution Tool (conv); Computes adjoint gradient decomposition.
   5) Tracer Tool (trc); Computes passive tracer integration. 

   For brief descriptions of each, see individual README files, 
   PUBLICDIR/README_***
   where *** is the tools' abreviation in parentheses () above.

How to run the Tool:
   For each tool, execute shell script emu_***.csh and follow its
   prompt, where *** is the tools' abreviation in parentheses ()
   above; e.g., source PUBLICDIR/emu_***.csh

ECCO Modeling Utilities (EMU): A Brief Description
===================================================

What EMU does:
   EMU is a collection of computational tools for analyzing the ECCO
   model itself, in addition to its state (flux-forced version of ECCO
   Version 4 Release 4). The tools (and their abbreviations) include
   the following;

   1) Sampling (samp); Evaluates time-series of the model state. 
   2) Forward Gradient (fgrd); Computes state's forward gradient. 
   3) Adjoint (adj); Computes state's adjoint gradient. 
   4) Convolution (conv); Evaluates adjoint gradient decomposition.
   5) Tracer (trc); Computes passive tracer evolution.
   6) Budget (budg); Evaluates contributions to a quantity's budget.
   7) Modified Simulation (msim); Runs V4r4 with modified input.
   8) Attribution (atrb); Evaluates state time-series by control type. 
   9) Auxiliary (aux): Generates user input files for other EMU tools.

   For brief descriptions of each, see individual README files, 
   PUBLICDIR/README_***
   where *** is the tools' abreviation in parentheses () above.

   EMU also provides programs for interactively reading and plotting
   EMU's output in select programming environments. See 
   PUBLICDIR/README_plot 

How to run EMU:
   Execute command 
   PUBLICDIR/emu 
   (linked to emu.sh) and follow its prompt.

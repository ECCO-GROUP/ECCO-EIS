EMU Plotting Tool: Reading and Plotting EMU Results 
===================================================

EMU provides programs (emu_plot) for interactively reading and
plotting EMU output in select programming environments;
   MATLAB 
   Python 
   IDL 

How to run emu_plot 
   Execute program emu_plot.??? found in sub-directories of the
   corresponding programming environment above in
   PUBLICDIR 
   and follow its prompts. 

   The program emu_plot reads output from EMU-generated
   directories. Users must not rename these directories or modify
   their sub-directory structure.

   - For all tools except the Modified Simulation Tool and Auxiliary
     Tools, emu_plot accesses files located in the output
     sub-directory.

   - For the Modified Simulation Tool, emu_plot accesses files located
     in the diags sub-directory.

   - Output from the Auxiliary Tools is not supported by emu_plot, as
     it varies by application.

   When analyzing EMU output on a system other than the one where EMU
   Tools were executed, download the complete EMU output directories,
   including their sub-directories. For example:
      emu_samp_blahblahblah/output/* 
      emu_msim_blahblahblah/diags/* 

   See README_??? files found in the respective sub-directories for
   additional information.
